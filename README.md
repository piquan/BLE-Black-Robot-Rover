This is a series of cleanups and changes to the AdaBox002 Rover code
from Adafruit.

The first few commits are generally useful to others (reformatting,
etc), but later commits are specific to my own needs.  However,
everything I'm putting on https://github.com/piquan/BLE-Black-Robot-Rover
is open source (see LICENSE), and you're welcome to it.

For more details on the AdaBox002 Rover project, please visit

Adafruit invests time and resources providing this open source design,
please support Adafruit and open-source hardware by purchasing
products from Adafruit!
